# 🌐 Networking Projects Portfolio

## Project Description
This repository contains a collection of practical exercises and configuration files demonstrating foundational concepts in computer networking. The primary focus is on simulating and documenting common network setups using **Cisco Packet Tracer** and related technical documentation.

## 📁 Repository Structure
The project files are organized into distinct directories based on the core networking concept explored:

| Folder | Concept | Contents |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [VLAN](VLAN/) | **Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs)** | Contains the Packet Tracer file and PDF guide for configuring and verifying VLAN segmentation. |
| [Subnetting](Subnetting/) | **IP Subnetting and Addressing** | Contains the Packet Tracer file and PDF guide demonstrating efficient network segmentation using IP subnet masks. |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Cisco Packet Tracer** (Used for all network simulation and configuration)
* **Markdown** (.md files)
* **PDF** (Documentation and Lab Reports)

## 🔑 Key Concepts Covered
* IP Addressing (IPv4)
